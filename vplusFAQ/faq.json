  "A Valheim Game update was just released, what should I do?": {
    "answerweb": "A new Valheim game update is unlikely to do any more than partially breaking Valheim Plus, however sometimes things are changed in the base game which may completely stop the mod working. In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature- wait for it to download/update all files and then simply unpack the valheim_Data folder from the downloaded package into your game folder again. This should resolve any issues related.",

  "I cannot connect to my server! It always tells me 'Incompatible version'": {
    "answerweb": "There are a few things that can cause this issue. Please follow the steps below.<br><h5>Check the version of Valheim and Valheim Plus on your Game Client and Server:</h5><br><ul><li>Check the version of your game client, to do this, launch Valheim and take a look in the bottom right corner, it should say: \"Version: 0.148.7, Valheim Plus: 0.9.7\", keep a note of those version numbers.</li><li>Check the version of your Valheim server. This will vary depending on how your server is hosted:</li><ul><li>If you use \"Valheim Dedicated Server\" on your Steam library, you can check the version by looking through the server console window, look for a line that looks like this: \"03/29/2021 16:54:09: Valheim version:0.148.7@0.9.\".</li><li>If you use SteamCMD to host your server, the same instructions above should apply. If you use a a server hosting provider (such as ZAP hosting), it should tell you your servers game version in the server control panel/dashboard or the online console. For example, in ZAP Hosting, the console shows the following line: \"[Info : Unity Log] Version generated with enforced mod : 0.148.7@0.9.7\".</li></ul><li>If the version on your server and on your client match exactly, you do not need to worry about this step. If they do not match, it means either the game or the client is outdated in some way. To Fix this, you should check for updates on the Steam game client, your server client and also make sure you are on the latest version of Valheim Plus. The latest Valheim Plus version is: 0.9.7</li></ul><br><h5>Check you have the latest config file for Valheim Plus:</h5><br><ul><li>Another reason that you might get \"incompatible version\" is because you haven't upgraded to a new version of the config file. To check this, you can do the following:</li><ul><li>Go to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest\">https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest</a>, and look at the \"valheim_plus.cfg\" file. You may notice it has new options in there. </li><li>If you need to upgrade to the latest config, you can do so by using this website: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://valheim-plus-config.web.app\">https://valheim-plus-config.web.app/</a>.Paste your old config file in to left hand box and choose merge config files, run through the following page which will let you set new options, then save the new config it gives you over the top of your old one. You need to update this config file on your game client and on your server.</li></ul></ul><br><h5>enforceMod is set differently on the game client and on the server:</h5><br>\n<ul><li>Check your config, if you have enforceMod=true set on your server, but enforceMod=false set on your game client, this will cause the incompatible version. Both need to be set to the same. The recommended option is setting it to true, so players who don't use Valheim Plus don't join your server (this would ruin your world).</li></ul><br><h5>Other mods out of date or incompatible:</h5><br><ul><li>You will also need to check for updates to other mods, or possibly remove other mods depending on whether or not they are compatible with the latest game version.</li><li>To do this, please check on the mod's download page, or the mod developer's Discord server.</li></ul>",
    "answerdiscord": "Please make sure that your own client and the server have the appropriate settings configured in their valheim_plus.cfg. If you have enforceConfiguration and enforceMod enabled, only people with the same configuration and mod version can join your server. You can only join servers with the same mod and configuration.",
